# DataManagerGUI
This is the client for the [DataManagerServer](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/DataManagerServer). It's features are the same as the CLI one's, so
if you are more interested in working with the command line rather than using your desktop, go ahead and check it out
[here](https://github.com/DataManager-Go/DataManagerCLI).

# Installation
If you want to compile the GUI yourself:
<br>
```git clone https://github.com/DataManager-Go/DataManagerGUI``` <br>
```cd DataManagerGUI``` <br>
```go build``` <br>

This however won't create an all-in-one executable - you will need to have the resources in the same folder as the binary.<br>
Therefore, I recommend using shortcuts.
<br>

Check out my [Install Wizard](https://github.com/Yukaru-san/InstallWizard) to create a portable installer containing all files needed if you want to use the program on another computer!

# First Start
On your first start, the program will need to download the electron binaries.

<sub><sup>The yes/no buttons depend on your system's language</sup></sub>

After accepting, the program might take a few seconds to start - depending on your internet connection.

# Look & Feel
