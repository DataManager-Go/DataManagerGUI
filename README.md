# DataManagerGUI
This is the client for the [DataManagerServer](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/DataManagerServer). It's features are the same as the CLI one's, so
if you are more interested in working with the command line rather than using your desktop, go ahead and check it out
[here](https://github.com/DataManager-Go/DataManagerCLI).

# Installation
If you want to compile the GUI yourself you can do so by pulling this repository and compiling it using ```go build``` inside it's directory. This however won't create an all-in-one executable - you will need to have the resources in the same folder as the binary.<br>
Check out my [Install Wizard](https://github.com/Yukaru-san/InstallWizard) if you want to pack all files into one executable.
Please note though that this will not pack this program into one binary but rather create an installer that can be used to unpack the data
whereever you want.
